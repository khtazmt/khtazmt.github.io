			- >We next tested the effect of ozone water on SARS‐CoV‐2 infectivity. Addition of 1.0 and 2.0 mg/L ozone to water for 10 s reduced infectivity by about 2 and 3 logs, respectively (Table [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7753712/table/mim12861-tbl-0004/)). Treatment with 0.4 and 0.7 mg/L ozone water resulted in a 94.2% and 99.5% decrease, respectively (Table [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7753712/table/mim12861-tbl-0005/)). Although the slope of the functions in Experiments 1 and 2 were slightly different (Figure [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7753712/figure/mim12861-fig-0003/)), efficacy of ozone water was seen in both.
			- >We here examined whether SARS‐CoV‐2 in large droplets (1 μL), assuming those produced by sneezing, could be inactivated by hand washing or rubbing for a short period of time (10 s) with plenty of ozone water (100 μL), produced from a portable ozone water generator. Since ozone water inactivated the virus (Tables [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7753712/table/mim12861-tbl-0004/) and [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7753712/table/mim12861-tbl-0005/), Figure [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7753712/figure/mim12861-fig-0003/)), portable ozone water generators may be suitable surrogates for alcohol sprays. Also, ozone water is less harmful to the skin and mucus membranes than alcohol and detergents, which, unlike ozone water, can cause allergic reactions and skin roughness.

				- >利用臭氧浓度为1.0mg/L的臭氧水处理10秒钟后，感染病毒的病毒滴度降至0.70％，利用浓度为2.0mg/L的臭氧水处理同样时间，病毒滴度降至0.1％以下。即使臭氧浓度只有0.4mg/L，病毒滴度也能降至5.8％。

				- >To further determine the minimal ozone water concentration required to inactivate SARS-CoV-2, ozone water was serially diluted and incubated with the viral solution (4.0 × 104 PFU/mL) for 1 min to inactivate the virus. We found that SARS-CoV-2 was fully inactivated by ozone water harboring 36 mg/L and 18 mg/L ozone, as neither viral genomic RNA nor viral plaques were detected (Fig. [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8010484/figure/Fig1/)F, 1G). However, when ozone concentration was below 9 mg/L in ozone water, the genomic RNA copy number of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the range of 4.0 × 103 and 5.0 × 105 copies/mL (Fig. [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8010484/figure/Fig1/)F), and the virus titer was between 1.0 × 102 and 7.0 × 102 PFU/mL (Fig. [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8010484/figure/Fig1/)G). The above results implied that ozone concentration above 18 mg/L could effectively eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity within 1 min.

			- >At low level of ozone of 0.1ppm, >90% reduction of both viruses was achieved after 3h exposure at 85% and 55% humidity. At 1.2ppm, >90% reduction of both viruses was achieved after 0.5h exposure at 85% humidity. Ozone at 0.07ppm, however, did not show good efficacy as reduction not exceeding 90% was achieved only after 8h exposure at 85% and 55% humidity.
